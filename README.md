- 👋 Hi, I’m @hasica31
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring a potential career change by tumbling into the world of coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via The Odin Project and dabbling in Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me push my boundaries, widen my horizons and help me on the path to coding superstardom
- 📫 How to reach me ...until i explore what's going on a little more...then on here, i guess?
